<h4>Occupado</h4>
<h1>everybody poops</h1>

Occupado is a system developed for the A Thinking Ape Summer 2014 Co-op Hackathon.
It uses magnetic door sensors to determine which bathrooms are occupied (i.e. which have their doors closed).
Occupado was developed for an office with two floors, each with two bathrooms. A Raspberry Pi on each floor
reads the door sensors and communicates changes in door status to the sever. The server displays which bathroom
doors are closed, as well as some statistics about bathroom usage.
